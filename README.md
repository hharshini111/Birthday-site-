Birthday Site(pretty basic)
This little project is a simple birthday website with some fun visuals and a bit of animation. I just named it “Birthday Site”-keeping it simple.

I made it because I wanted a different way to wish instead of just a text. Plus, I figured it’d be a nice way to practice a bit of JavaScript.

I built it using basic web stuff—HTML for the structure, CSS for the colors and animations, and JavaScript to handle things like confetti and balloons on vs code.

The hardest part was getting the balloons to look less like eggs and to make them float side to side after they fly up. Along the way, I learned that there's a library for the confetti and that it can be a pain to code a balloon with java(but it is possible).
